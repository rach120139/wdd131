      <p>DI is an organization owned by The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints. DI helps people improve thier lives through work, training, and education, and sells low cost goods. It was established in 1938 to be a job training facility, deseret means ‚Äúhoney bee‚Äù (Ether 2:3). The honeybee represents hard work, productivity, and collaboration. 
        In 1938, Heber J. Grant‚ÄîPresident of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints‚Äîestablished Deseret Industries to help members of the Church and others in the community. In an editorial following the dedication of the first Deseret Industries location, Elder John A. Widtsoe‚Äîan Apostle of the Church‚Äîidentified four guiding purposes (‚ÄúEditorial: Deseret Industries,‚Äù Improvement Era, Sept. 1938, 544): 
        
        Those who have will be given another type of opportunity to help those who have not. 
        
        Waste will be reduced by keeping our possessions in use as long as possible. 
        
        The work will employ many now unemployed. 
        
        Articles in common use, of good quality, will be available at a low cost. 
        
        The Quorum of the Twelve and Presiding Bishopric encouraged members of local Latter-day Saint congregations to donate items like clothing, furniture, electrical fixtures, metal, and glassware. These items would be sorted, processed, and repaired by men and women employed by Deseret Industries. The items would also be sold to community members at a minimum cost. Deseret Industries has approximately 1.9k employees as of May 2025. The average annual salary for employees in the United States is $68,235.
